Side-effects:
 any operation that reaches outside of the functional scope of a React component. 
These operations can affect other components, interact with the browser, or perform an asynchronous
data fetching. 

Hooks: hooks 
are the inbuilt react features that let you use state and other react features without 
writing a class. They enable functional components to have access to stateful logic and lifecycle features. 
which were previously only possible through class components. 
common hooks: 
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useCallback
4. useMemo
5. useRef
6. useContext

useEffect: 
allows you to perform sideeffects in functional components. Side effects are operations that can 
affect other components or cant be done during rendering such as data fetching, subscriptions, 
or manually changing the DOM. Basically a function to run only on first load/render and never render/run it 
again unless in specific conditions. 

useMemo: 
means remembering some output given an input and not computing it again. Whenever a value changes, the render and the logic
runs on the fly.  while in useeffect, the value first changes and then the render happens. 

useCallback: 
is a hook, used to memoize functions to help optimizing performance of an application, especially in cases involving 
chaild components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders. 

 useRef: gives access to DOM elements.
