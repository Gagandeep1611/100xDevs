What are routes: 
react-router-dom, fetching/rendering new page as you click or go to a different website extension. 


useNavigate hook lets you navigate from one route to another. You cannot use useNavigate outsite browser router. 


What is lazy loading:
When we load, entire bundle including the jsx and html files comes back all at once and then 
client side routing is done. 
load only the code thats needed as per the page that the user is on. 
 
Suspense is used to show something till the original component loads. 

Prop drilling: passing down values manually from a closest common ancestor. 

ContextAPI: helps in overcoming prop drilling and make the syntax cleaner. 

State management library(Recoil, Redux and Zustand): overcomes the shortcomings of state management library i.e, rerendering not needed components. 
it is a cleaner way to store the state of your app.

Recoil: 
Atom: smallest unit of state. can be defined outsite the component and teleported to anywhere.     


Selector: a selector is a piece of derived state. you can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function 
that derives a new value from the said state. 
use useMemo whenver you need a value to desire based on some dependency.
